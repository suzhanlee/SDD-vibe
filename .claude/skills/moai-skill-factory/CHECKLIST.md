## Quick Validation Script

Use this bash script for automated validation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

SKILL_PATH=$1
SCORE=0
MAX_SCORE=85

echo "üîç Validating Skill: $SKILL_PATH"
echo "‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ"

# Check SKILL.md exists
if [[ -f "$SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md" ]]; then
  echo "‚úì SKILL.md found"
  ((SCORE+=5))
else
  echo "‚úó SKILL.md missing"
fi

# Check metadata
if grep -q "^name:" "$SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md"; then
  echo "‚úì name field present"
  ((SCORE+=2))
else
  echo "‚úó name field missing"
fi

if grep -q "^description:" "$SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md"; then
  echo "‚úì description field present"
  ((SCORE+=2))
else
  echo "‚úó description field missing"
fi

# Check file count
FILE_COUNT=$(find "$SKILL_PATH" -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l)
if [[ $FILE_COUNT -lt 10 ]]; then
  echo "‚úì Reasonable file count ($FILE_COUNT files)"
  ((SCORE+=3))
else
  echo "‚ö† Many files ($FILE_COUNT), consider consolidation"
fi

# Check line count
SKILL_LINES=$(wc -l < "$SKILL_PATH/SKILL.md" || echo 0)
if [[ $SKILL_LINES -le 500 ]]; then
  echo "‚úì SKILL.md within limits ($SKILL_LINES lines)"
  ((SCORE+=3))
else
  echo "‚úó SKILL.md too large ($SKILL_LINES lines, max 500)"
fi

echo "‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ"
echo "Score: $SCORE/$MAX_SCORE"

if [[ $SCORE -ge 75 ]]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Ready for publication"
  exit 0
else
  echo "‚ùå Needs improvement"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Usage**:
